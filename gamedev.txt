I spent the last few days working on procedural mesh generation.  First looking to find a bit of code to do what I had in mind.  Which begs the question: What was did I have in mind?   I just want a cube mesh such that for a unit cube centered on the origin: input (n = number of verts per edge)
output 6nsquared verts in clockwise order for the faces of the cube.  Maybe input a flag the inside vs the outside faces.  I did not want to hand code a single vertex and did not want to load a mesh file.   I am sure the code is out there somewhere, but was not finding it.  So, a bit reluctantly at first, I started coding the mesh generator.  And I started enjoying creating this thing and stopped searching for the "out there somewhere" code; although still curious how others did this.   

First question: How to number the verts?  It would be great to concieve of some concise algorithm to put out the verts for 12nsquared triangles all in clockwise order for the outside faces of the cube directly.  It would be great to have an Eulerian math mind also. 

I decided to just use the simplest algorithm I could devise to generate verts and number them sequentially as they were produced.  The algorithm was presumably ordered and presumably would output verts in some order.
